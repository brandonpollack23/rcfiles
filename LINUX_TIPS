# Program logs

## How it is done
Logs are collected by a special daemon called rsyslogd.
Depending on subsystem and priority, decides if it should be logged, where, and if it should be sent to the administrator console (tty0)
(they actually go to systemd first, so systemd's journal has it as well, journalctl).

some things log manage themselves (eg samba)

## Where
/vars/logs/

## Helper utilities that exist

### Alerting utils
logcheck

### Analysis
analog, awstats, webalizer, etc
